# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this.

Challenge was to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


*I had fun building this!*.
